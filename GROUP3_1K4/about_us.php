			<div class="about"><p>In a small dainty mushroom house out in the middle of a forest, there is a witch and her apprentice. Their names are Lady Esma and Little Ruru. Lady Esma is currently teaching Ruru how to brew potions, but unfortunately, they've run out of mushrooms! Mushrooms are a key component of their brewery, and they can't afford to leave it out of the recipe. So, she sends out Ruru to go fetch them some.

Although they live in a forest, there's not many mushrooms around the area. This is most likely because Ruru and Esma have plucked them all out. So, Ruru has to go venture farther away from her home. during her adventure, she finds different kinds of mushrooms, but none of them are the ones Lady Esma need.

At last, she stumbles into a cave and finds a whole patch of mushrooms! Even better, they're exactly the kind that she and Lady Esma use for potions, so these must be the right mushrooms!

In the end, Ruru happily strolls back home with the mushrooms in hand and greets Lady Esma with a big smile!</p></div>
